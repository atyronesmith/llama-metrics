# Phase 1 Completion Summary: Service Consolidation

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Created New Directory Structure
```
services/
├── proxy/           # Ollama monitoring proxy (moved from root)
├── dashboard/       # Real-time web dashboard (moved from root)
├── health/         # Health checker service (moved from root)
└── shared/         # NEW: Shared packages for all services
    ├── config/     # Unified configuration management
    ├── metrics/    # Common Prometheus metrics
    └── models/     # Shared data structures
```

### 2. Created Shared Packages

#### `services/shared/config/config.go`
- **BaseConfig**: Common configuration for all services (ports, timeouts, health checks)
- **PrometheusConfig**: Prometheus-specific settings
- **OllamaConfig**: Ollama connection settings
- **Helper functions**: Environment variable loaders with type safety
- **Validation**: Built-in configuration validation

#### `services/shared/metrics/metrics.go`
- **Request metrics**: Counter, duration histogram, active requests gauge
- **Response metrics**: Size histogram
- **Error tracking**: Error counter by type
- **Ollama metrics**: Token generation, model loading times
- **Queue metrics**: Size and wait time
- **System metrics**: CPU, memory, GPU usage
- **Service info**: Version tracking

#### `services/shared/models/models.go`
- **Health models**: HealthStatus, HealthCheck
- **Ollama models**: Request/Response structures
- **Error models**: Standardized error responses
- **Metrics models**: Snapshot and system metrics
- **Constants**: Status values, message roles

### 3. Updated Services to Use Shared Packages

#### Proxy Service (`services/proxy/`)
- Updated `pkg/config/config.go` to extend shared BaseConfig
- Added shared module dependency in go.mod
- Maintains proxy-specific configuration while using shared base

#### Dashboard Service (`services/dashboard/`)
- Updated `pkg/config/config.go` to use shared configs
- Embedded BaseConfig, PrometheusConfig, and OllamaConfig
- Added shared module dependency

#### Health Service (`services/health/`)
- Updated `pkg/config/config.go` to embed shared configs
- Maintains YAML-based configuration with shared structures
- Added shared module dependency

### 4. Standardized Makefiles

Created `services/Makefile.template` with:
- **Consistent targets**: build, run, dev, test, lint, fmt, vet, deps, install, docker
- **Version management**: Git-based versioning with build metadata
- **Color-coded output**: Better visibility for different operations
- **Help system**: Self-documenting with `make help`
- **Service-specific targets**: Each service can add custom targets

Updated all three service Makefiles to follow the standard:
- **Proxy**: Added `run-with-ollama` and `benchmark` targets
- **Dashboard**: Added `watch` and `open` targets
- **Health**: Added `check` and `analyze` targets

### 5. Created Go Workspace

`go.work` file manages all modules:
```go
go 1.24.4

use (
    ./services/proxy
    ./services/dashboard
    ./services/health
    ./services/shared
)
```

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Reusability**: Shared packages eliminate duplication
2. **Consistency**: All services follow the same patterns
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to shared code benefit all services
4. **Type Safety**: Shared models ensure consistent data structures
5. **Developer Experience**: Standardized Makefiles and clear structure

## 📝 Migration Notes

### Import Path Updates Required
Services need to update imports to use shared packages:
```go
import (
    sharedconfig "github.com/llama-metrics/shared/config"
    sharedmetrics "github.com/llama-metrics/shared/metrics"
    sharedmodels "github.com/llama-metrics/shared/models"
)
```

### Dependency Management
Each service includes a `replace` directive for local development:
```go
replace github.com/llama-metrics/shared => ../shared
```

### Version Compatibility
- Dashboard requires Go 1.24.4
- Other services use Go 1.21
- Workspace file set to highest version (1.24.4)

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Test Services**: Ensure all services build and run correctly
2. **Update Imports**: Replace internal models/metrics with shared ones
3. **Remove Duplicates**: Delete redundant code from individual services
4. **CI/CD Updates**: Update build pipelines for new structure
5. **Documentation**: Update service READMEs for new structure

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test proxy build
cd services/proxy && make build

# Test dashboard build
cd services/dashboard && make build

# Test health build
cd services/health && make build

# Run all tests
for service in proxy dashboard health; do
    echo "Testing $service..."
    cd services/$service && make test
    cd ../..
done
```

Phase 1 is now complete. The foundation for a well-structured, maintainable codebase is in place.
