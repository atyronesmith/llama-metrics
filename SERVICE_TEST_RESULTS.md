# Service Test Results

## Summary
✅ **All services build and run successfully after Phase 1 changes!**

## Test Results

### 1. Proxy Service ✅
- **Build**: Successful
- **Binary**: `build/ollama-proxy` (10.7 MB)
- **Command-line**: Works correctly with expected flags
- **Issues Found**: None
- **Build Time**: ~5 seconds

### 2. Dashboard Service ✅
- **Build**: Successful (after minor fix)
- **Binary**: `build/llama-dashboard` (13.5 MB)
- **Command-line**: Starts correctly, initializes routes
- **Issues Found**:
  - Fixed: `cfg.OllamaURL` → `cfg.OllamaConfig.URL` in main.go
- **Build Time**: ~3 seconds

### 3. Health Service ✅
- **Build**: Successful
- **Binary**: `build/llama-health` (8.5 MB)
- **Command-line**: Works correctly with expected flags
- **Issues Found**: None
- **Build Time**: ~2 seconds

## Shared Packages Integration
All services successfully integrated with the new shared packages:
- ✅ `github.com/llama-metrics/shared/config`
- ✅ `github.com/llama-metrics/shared/metrics`
- ✅ `github.com/llama-metrics/shared/models`

## Makefile Standardization
All standardized Makefile targets work correctly:
- ✅ `make build` - Builds binaries
- ✅ `make help` - Shows help information
- ✅ `make test-short` - Runs tests (no test files currently)
- ✅ `make clean` - Cleans build artifacts

## Next Steps Recommended
1. Add unit tests for each service
2. Test runtime behavior with actual Ollama instance
3. Verify Prometheus metrics exposure
4. Test service intercommunication

## Commands for Quick Testing
```bash
# Build all services
for service in proxy dashboard health; do
    echo "Building $service..."
    cd services/$service && make build && cd ../..
done

# Run proxy (requires Ollama running)
./services/proxy/build/ollama-proxy

# Run dashboard
./services/dashboard/build/llama-dashboard

# Run health check
./services/health/build/llama-health --mode cli --check simple
```
